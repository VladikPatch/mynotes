# MyNotes App

MyNotes is the first app I created while following a 37-hour YouTube course by Vandad Nahavandipoor [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8). It's a simple note-taking app built with Flutter that allows users to register, log in, create, edit, and view personal notes.

## Built With

- **Flutter**
- **Dart**
- **Google Firebase**
- **flutter_bloc** (state management)
- **firebase_core**, and other common libraries

## Features

- User authentication (register, login, logout)
- Create, view, edit, and delete notes
- Notes saved per user via Firebase
- Clean UI and responsive layout

## Firebase Configuration

To run the app locally, you'll need your own Firebase setup.

Create your own Firebase project and add the following files (not included in this repo for security reasons):

- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist`

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand:
- The basics of Flutter and Dart
- How Firebase integrates with Flutter
- State management using BLoC
- Structuring a real-world Flutter project
